# 我的第五篇博客文章

发表于：2025-01-15

欢迎来到我学习关于 Astro 的新博客！在这里，我将分享我建立新网站的学习历程。

## 我做了什么

1.  **加勒比海盗**：Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

2.  **精彩片段**：Must go faster. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

3.  **第三段**：Life finds a way. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. What do they got in there? King Kong? Checkmate... Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?

4.  **第四段**：So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Did he just throw my cat out of the window?

5.  **第五段**：Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!

6.  **第六段**：Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Checkmate... Life finds a way.

7.  **第七段**：Life finds a way. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.

8.  **第八段**：So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Just my luck, no ice. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Checkmate... Did he just throw my cat out of the window?

9.  **第九段**：Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Life finds a way. You really think you can fly that thing? Must go faster. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

10. **结尾**：This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
